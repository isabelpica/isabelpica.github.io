    <h1>IEP</h1>
    <p>This Narrative Poster project is called “IEP.” Created in Illustrator, this oversized poster is 24 inches long and 18 inches tall. This project was assigned in Graphic Design 2 and was completed on April 4, 2019. Students were asked to think back and remember a time in life that made them who they are today. This poster is about not being accepted and labeled as different in school. Kids who are labeled as “different” often struggle amongst their peers. This poster sheds light on this issue.</p>
