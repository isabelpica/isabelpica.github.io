    <h1>Unplug</h1>
    <p>This Type as Image project is called “Unplug.” Created in Illustrator and Photoshop.  The oversized poster is 24 inches long and 18 inches tall. This project was assigned in Typography 2 and was completed on April 23, 2019. Students were asked to pick a topic and a word that corresponds with it. An image was used to replace a letter in that word. This poster is about social media and how people should put down their phones and enjoy the world around them.</p>
